# PHYS460-Quantum-Tunneling-Project

Simulate a quantum particle incident on a potential barrier, and observe tunneling of wave packet.

This repo currently has the write-up of the simulation, which should be an interesting read, but the code used to create the simulation has not yet been added. Once I have time I would like to rewrite my current python file into a Juypter notebook so others can see how the simulation was done.
